## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API key
- Ollama installed locally

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd ollama-tutor
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Set up environment variables**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Add your OpenAI API key to .env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

4. **Set up Ollama**
```bash
# Install Ollama (if not already installed)
curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh

# Pull the Llama 3.2 model
ollama pull llama3.2
```

5. **Launch the notebook**
```bash
jupyter notebook "Ollama 6 to12 grade tutorchat.ipynb"
```

## üìñ Usage

### Interactive Chat Mode
```python
# Run the chat interface
chat_with_ollama()
```

Example session:
```
You: What is photosynthesis?
Ollama: Great question! Think of plants like solar-powered food factories...
```

### Single Question Mode
```python
# Ask a specific question
question = "Explain quadratic equations in simple terms"
# The system will provide a comprehensive, grade-appropriate explanation
```

### Customizable Teaching
- Modify `system_prompt` to adjust teaching style
- Change `MODEL_GPT` or `MODEL_LLAMA` to use different AI models
- Adjust grade level and complexity in the system prompt

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Core Components
- **AI Integration**: Seamless switching between OpenAI and Ollama
- **Streaming Display**: Real-time Markdown rendering with IPython
