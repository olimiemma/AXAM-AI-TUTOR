    "üèÄ **Basketball shot**: When you shoot a basketball, it follows a perfect parabolic path. The equation y = -16t¬≤ + v‚ÇÄt + h‚ÇÄ describes the ball's height (y) at any time (t).\n",

    "\n",
    "The key features tell us important information:\n",
    "- **Vertex**: The highest or lowest point (maximum profit, peak of the ball's flight)\n",
    "- **Axis of symmetry**: The line of balance (x = -b/2a)\n",
    "- **y-intercept**: The starting point (initial height, startup costs)\n",
    "- **x-intercepts**: Where the parabola crosses zero (break-even points, when ball hits ground)\n",

    "For y = -2x¬≤ + 100x - 800:\n",
    "- This opens downward (a = -2 is negative)\n",

    "\n",
    "**The Goal**: Every atom wants to have a full outer electron shell (usually 8 electrons, called the 'octet rule'). Think of it like wanting a complete set of something.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Three Ways Atoms 'Make Friends'**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ionic Bonding** (opposites attract):\n",
    "   - Like a generous person giving a gift to someone who needs it\n",
    "   - Sodium (Na) has 1 extra electron it wants to give away\n",
    "   - Chlorine (Cl) needs 1 electron to complete its set\n",
    "   - Na gives its electron to Cl ‚Üí Na‚Å∫ and Cl‚Åª ‚Üí NaCl (table salt!)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Covalent Bonding** (sharing is caring):\n",
    "   - Like two friends sharing pizza so both get enough\n",
    "   - Two hydrogen atoms each have 1 electron but need 2\n",
    "   - They share their electrons: H-H ‚Üí H‚ÇÇ (hydrogen gas)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Metallic Bonding** (community sharing):\n",
    "   - Like a neighborhood tool library where everyone shares\n",
    "   - Metal atoms share electrons in a 'sea of electrons'\n",
    "   - This is why metals conduct electricity - electrons can move freely!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Memory device**: 'Give, Share, or Pool' - atoms either give/take electrons (ionic), share electrons (covalent), or pool electrons together (metallic).\n",

    "- You need 10 liters of 30% acid solution\n",
    "- You have 20% and 50% acid solutions available\n",
    "- How much of each do you mix?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario 3: Business Planning**\n",
    "- A company has fixed costs of $5,000/month\n",
    "- Variable costs are $12 per unit, selling price is $25 per unit\n",
    "- At what production level do they break even?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution Strategy - Substitution Method**:\n",
    "From equation 1: s = 200 - a\n",
    "Substitute into equation 2: 15a + 8(200 - a) = 2,100\n",

       "The code you provided is a generator expression that utilizes the `yield from` statement along with a set comprehension. Let's break it down step by step:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Iteration over `books`:** The code is iterating over an iterable called `books`. This would typically be a list (or another iterable) of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a book.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Set comprehension:** Inside the `yield from`, there is a set comprehension:\n",
       "   python\n",
       "   {book.get(\"author\") for book in books if book.get(\"author\")}\n",
       "   \n",
       "   - The comprehension creates a set of authors by accessing the `\"author\"` key in each book dictionary using `book.get(\"author\")`.\n",
       "   - The `if book.get(\"author\")` condition filters the books so that only those with a defined (non-None and not empty) author are considered. \n",
       "   - Using `.get(\"author\")` means that if the key `\"author\"` does not exist in the dictionary, it will return `None` (or whatever default you specify), which ensures that key errors are avoided.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Set Structure:** The use of curly braces `{}` creates a set. This means the expression will only keep unique author names, discarding any duplicates.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **`yield from`:** The `yield from` statement is used in a generator function to yield each value from the iterable that is provided to it.\n",
       "   - In this case, it yields each unique author's name from the set created by the comprehension.\n",
       "   - This allows you to conveniently provide output from a subset of your data (in this case, unique authors) without needing to create a separate list or collect results in another way.\n",
