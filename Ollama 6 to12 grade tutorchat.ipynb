    "The key features tell us important information:\n",
    "- **Vertex**: The highest or lowest point (maximum profit, peak of the ball's flight)\n",

    "\n",
    "**The Goal**: Every atom wants to have a full outer electron shell (usually 8 electrons, called the 'octet rule'). Think of it like wanting a complete set of something.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Three Ways Atoms 'Make Friends'**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ionic Bonding** (opposites attract):\n",

    "   - Sodium (Na) has 1 extra electron it wants to give away\n",
    "   - Chlorine (Cl) needs 1 electron to complete its set\n",
    "   - Na gives its electron to Cl ‚Üí Na‚Å∫ and Cl‚Åª ‚Üí NaCl (table salt!)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Covalent Bonding** (sharing is caring):\n",
    "   - Like two friends sharing pizza so both get enough\n",
    "   - Two hydrogen atoms each have 1 electron but need 2\n",
    "   - They share their electrons: H-H ‚Üí H‚ÇÇ (hydrogen gas)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Metallic Bonding** (community sharing):\n",
    "   - Like a neighborhood tool library where everyone shares\n",
    "   - Metal atoms share electrons in a 'sea of electrons'\n",
    "   - This is why metals conduct electricity - electrons can move freely!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Memory device**: 'Give, Share, or Pool' - atoms either give/take electrons (ionic), share electrons (covalent), or pool electrons together (metallic).\n",

    "- Variable costs are $12 per unit, selling price is $25 per unit\n",
    "- At what production level do they break even?\n",

       "The code you provided is a generator expression that utilizes the `yield from` statement along with a set comprehension. Let's break it down step by step:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Iteration over `books`:** The code is iterating over an iterable called `books`. This would typically be a list (or another iterable) of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a book.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Set comprehension:** Inside the `yield from`, there is a set comprehension:\n",
       "   python\n",
       "   {book.get(\"author\") for book in books if book.get(\"author\")}\n",
       "   \n",
       "   - The comprehension creates a set of authors by accessing the `\"author\"` key in each book dictionary using `book.get(\"author\")`.\n",
       "   - The `if book.get(\"author\")` condition filters the books so that only those with a defined (non-None and not empty) author are considered. \n",
       "   - Using `.get(\"author\")` means that if the key `\"author\"` does not exist in the dictionary, it will return `None` (or whatever default you specify), which ensures that key errors are avoided.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Set Structure:** The use of curly braces `{}` creates a set. This means the expression will only keep unique author names, discarding any duplicates.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **`yield from`:** The `yield from` statement is used in a generator function to yield each value from the iterable that is provided to it.\n",
       "   - In this case, it yields each unique author's name from the set created by the comprehension.\n",
       "   - This allows you to conveniently provide output from a subset of your data (in this case, unique authors) without needing to create a separate list or collect results in another way.\n",

       "This line of code is using a feature of Python called \"yield from\" which allows us to delegate the execution of a generator to another generator.\n",
       "\n",
       "Here's a breakdown of what it does:\n",
       "\n",
       "- `for book in books`: This part iterates over each item (`book`) in the list or dictionary (`books`).\n",
       "\n",
       "- `if book.get(\"author\")`: Before yielding, this line checks if the current item has an \"author\" key. If it doesn't, the loop will skip to the next iteration.\n",
       "\n",
       "- `{book.get(\"author\")}`: This is a generator expression that yields the value of the \"author\" key for each item where the key exists.\n",
       "\n",
       "- `yield from ...`: This line delegates the execution of the previous generator expression to the first yielded value. In other words, it passes control to the first generated value in the inner generator expression and resumes its execution when it returns (or raises an exception).\n",
       "\n",
       "So, overall, this line of code yields all authors that have a corresponding book in the `books` list or dictionary.\n",
       "\n",
       "This is useful for several reasons:\n",
       "\n",
       "- It reduces the amount of data that needs to be stored in memory. Instead of storing all books and then iterating over them to find authors, you store only the authors directly.\n",
       "\n",
       "- It's more memory-efficient because it avoids storing unnecessary data (in this case, all books).\n",
       "\n",
       "- If you want to process these authors further before yielding, you can do so before using `yield from`.\n",
